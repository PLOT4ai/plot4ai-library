Did you consider diversity and representativeness of users/individuals in the data?\n* When applying statistical generalisation, the risk exists of making inferences due to misrepresentation, for instance: a postal code where mostly young families live can discriminate the few old families living there because they are not properly represented in the group.",
        "recommendation": "* Who is covered and who is underrepresented?\n* Prevent disparate impact: when the output of a member of a minority group is disparate compared to representation of the group. Consider measuring the accuracy from minority classes too instead of measuring only the total accuracy. Adjusting the weighting factors to avoid disparate impact can result in positive discrimination which has also its own issues: disparate treatment.\n* One approach to addressing the problem of class imbalance is to randomly resample the training dataset. This technique can help to rebalance the class distribution when classes are under or over represented:\n - random oversampling (i.e. duplicating samples from the minority class)\n - random undersampling (i.e. deleting samples from the majority class)\n* There are trade-offs when determining an AI system’s metrics for success. It is important to balance performance metrics against the risk of negatively impacting vulnerable populations.\n* When using techniques like statistical generalisation is important to know your data well, and get familiarised with who is and who is not represented in the samples. Check the samples for expectations that can be easily verified. For example, if half the population is known to be female, then you can check if approximately half the sample is female.",

For example, suppose that the office cleaning robot earns rewards only if it does not see any garbage in the office.

For example: a “reward agent” could be trained by the human designer to check if a room has been properly cleaned by the cleaning robot.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)\n\n* When the agent is learning to perform a complex task, human oversight and feedback are more helpful than just rewards from the environment. Rewards are generally modelled such that they convey to what extent the task was completed, but they do not usually provide sufficient feedback about the safety implications of the agent’s actions. Even if the agent completes the task successfully, it may not be able to infer the side-effects of its actions from the rewards alone. In the ideal setting, a human would provide fine-grained supervision and feedback every time the agent performs an action (Scalable oversight). Though this would provide a much more informative view about the environment to the agent, such a strategy would require far too much time and effort from the human.

        "recommendation": "One promising research direction to tackle this problem is semi-supervised learning, where the agent is still evaluated on all the actions (or tasks), but receives rewards only for a small sample of those actions (or tasks).\n\nAnother promising research direction is hierarchical reinforcement learning, where a hierarchy is established between different learning agents. There could be a supervisor agent/robot whose task is to assign some work to another agent/robot and provide it with feedback and rewards.\nSource: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/concrete-ai-safety-problems/)",

        "recommendation": "* Personal data must not be stored longer than necessary for the intended purpose. (art.5 e GDPR). In order to comply with this principle it is important to have a clear overview of the data flow during the life cycle of the model.\n* You might receive raw data that you need to transform. Check what are you doing with this data and all the different types of input files you might be receiving/collecting.\n* Check if you need to store that data for quality and auditing purposes.\n* Check where are you going to store the data from the data preparation, the training and test sets, the outputs, the processed outputs (when they are merged or linked to other information), metrics, etc.\n* How long should all this data be stored? What type of deletion process can you put in place? And who will be responsible for the retention and deletion of this data?\n* Implement the right retention schedules when applicable. In case you might still need a big part of the data in order to feed the model, consider anonymising the data.\n* *Deleting* data from a trained model can be challenging to carry out (short of retraining the model from scratch from a dataset with the deleted data removed, but that is expensive and often infeasible). Note that through the learning process, input data are always encoded in some way in the model itself during training. That means the internal representation developed by the model during learning (say, thresholds and weights) may end up being legally encumbered as well.
