				"explanation": "Are you testing the product in a real environment before releasing it?\n When deploying an AI model, it is critical to ensure that it aligns with the intended use and functions effectively in its operational environment. If the model is trained and tested on data from one context but deployed in a different one, there is a significant risk of performance degradation or unintended behavior. This is particularly important in cases where environmental changes, unexpected inputs, or shifts in user interaction occur. Additionally, reinforcement learning models may require retraining when objectives or environments deviate slightly from the training setup. Beyond data, other contextual factors like legal, cultural, or operational constraints must be considered to ensure successful deployment",
				"recommendation": "* Use different data for testing and training. Make sure diversity is reflected in the data and that it aligns with the intended deployment environment. Specify your training approach, statistical methods, and ensure edge cases are adequately tested. Explore different environments and contexts to make sure your model is trained with the expected variations in data sources. \n* For reinforcement learning, ensure the objective functions are robust and adaptable to slight changes in the environment. \n* Are you considering enough aspects beyond data, such as legal, cultural, or operational factors? Did you forget any environmental variable that could affect performance or safety? Could limited sampling due to high costs or practical constraints pose a challenge? Document these risks and seek organizational support. The organization is accountable for mitigating or accepting these risks, which may require additional budget or resources. \n*  Consider applying techniques such as cultural effective challenge. This creates an environment where technology developers and stakeholders can actively participate in questioning the AI design and process. This approach better integrates social, cultural, and contextual factors into the design and helps prevent issues such as target leakage, where the AI system trains for an unintended purpose. \n* Set up mechanisms for real-time monitoring post-deployment.

This would help to minimize the unintended impact, without neutralizing the AI system.\n\nAnother approach would be training the agent to recognize harmful side effects so that it can avoid actions leading to such side effects.

For example, suppose that the office cleaning robot earns rewards only if it does not see any garbage in the office.

For example: a “reward agent” could be trained by the human designer to check if a room has been properly cleaned by the cleaning robot. If the cleaning robot shuts off its visual sensors to avoid seeing garbage and claims a high reward, the “reward agent” would mark the reward as invalid because the room is not clean.

				"question": "Can the data be representative of the different groups/populations?",
				"threatif": "No",
				"explanation": "It is important to reduce the risk of bias and different types of discrimination. Did you consider diversity and representativeness of users/individuals in the data?\n* When applying statistical generalisation, the risk exists of making inferences due to misrepresentation, for instance: a postal code where mostly young families live can discriminate the few old families living there because they are not properly represented in the group.",
				"recommendation": "* Who is covered and who is underrepresented?\n* Prevent disparate impact: when the output of a member of a minority group is disparate compared to representation of the group. Consider measuring the accuracy from minority classes too instead of measuring only the total accuracy. Adjusting the weighting factors to avoid disparate impact can result in positive discrimination which has also its own issues: disparate treatment.\n* One approach to addressing the problem of class imbalance is to randomly resample the training dataset. This technique can help to rebalance the class distribution when classes are under or over represented:\n - random oversampling (i.e. duplicating samples from the minority class)\n - random undersampling (i.e. deleting samples from the majority class)\n* There are trade-offs when determining an AI system’s metrics for success. It is important to balance performance metrics against the risk of negatively impacting vulnerable populations.\n* When using techniques like statistical generalisation is important to know your data well, and get familiarised with who is and who is not represented in the samples. Check the samples for expectations that can be easily verified. For example, if half the population is known to be female, then you can check if approximately half the sample is female.",

Foster safe environments where children can freely share their thoughts and ideas. Include features that support interactive and meaningful learning experiences. \n* Engage with experts in child development, education, and rights advocacy during the design phase. Consult children (where appropriate) to ensure their perspectives are respected and integrated. \n* Continuously monitor the AI system for unintended harms or risks to children. \n* Clearly communicate to parents, guardians, and educators how the AI system works and the measures in place to protect children.

				"question": "Can we provide human resources to supervise and give feedback to the actions of AI agents?",
				"threatif": "No",
				"explanation": "* Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)\n\n* When the agent is learning to perform a complex task, human oversight and feedback are more helpful than just rewards from the environment. Rewards are generally modelled such that they convey to what extent the task was completed, but they do not usually provide sufficient feedback about the safety implications of the agent’s actions. Even if the agent completes the task successfully, it may not be able to infer the side-effects of its actions from the rewards alone. In the ideal setting, a human would provide fine-grained supervision and feedback every time the agent performs an action (Scalable oversight). Though this would provide a much more informative view about the environment to the agent, such a strategy would require far too much time and effort from the human. Source: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/concrete-ai-safety-problems/)",
				"recommendation": "One promising research direction to tackle this problem is semi-supervised learning, where the agent is still evaluated on all the actions (or tasks), but receives rewards only for a small sample of those actions (or tasks).\n\nAnother promising research direction is hierarchical reinforcement learning, where a hierarchy is established between different learning agents. There could be a supervisor agent/robot whose task is to assign some work to another agent/robot and provide it with feedback and rewards.\nSource: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/concrete-ai-safety-problems/)",
