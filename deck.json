This is common where there is delay in data collection.\n* Do not use data in the training set based on information from the future: if X happened after Y, you shouldn’t build a model that uses X to predict Y.",

				"explanation": "* The principle of storage limitation, as stated in Article 5(e) of the GDPR, requires personal data to be stored only as long as necessary for the intended purpose. Similarly, many global privacy regulations, such as CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil), and PDPB (India), impose strict rules on data retention and deletion. Do you have a clear understanding of how long you need to keep the data (training data, output data, etc.) and whether you comply with internal, local, national, or international retention requirements?",
				"recommendation": " Personal data must not be stored longer than necessary for its intended purpose. To comply, it is essential to have a comprehensive overview of the data flow during the life cycle of the model.\n* Analyze all data types, including raw input data, training and testing sets, processed outputs (linked or merged data), and associated metrics. Understand where this data will be stored and for how long.\n* Define clear retention and deletion schedules, ensuring responsible individuals are assigned for managing data retention and disposal.\n* If data must be retained for auditing or quality purposes, anonymize it where possible to minimize privacy risks.\n* Stay informed about and comply with retention rules not only under GDPR but also under international frameworks such as CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), LGPD (Brazilian General Data Protection Law), and others. Retention and deletion policies should meet these diverse requirements. \n* Be aware that deleting data from a trained model is inherently challenging, as input data influences the model's internal representation during training. Consider legal implications for the model itself, as encoded thresholds and weights may also be subject to retention laws. Source: [BerryvilleiML](https://berryvilleiml.com/)",

Key data-related biases that contribute to it include:\n * Mismatch between the target population and the actual user base. \n*Underrepresentation of certain groups.\n*Flaws in the data collection/selection process, such as: \n  *Sampling bias: Data isn't randomly collected, skewing the representation. \n*Self-selection bias: Certain groups opt out, leading to gaps in the data. \n* Coverage bias: The data collection method fails to include all relevant segments of the population. ",
				"recommendation": "* Who is covered and who is underrepresented?\n* Prevent disparate impact: when the output of a member of a minority group is disparate compared to representation of the group. Consider measuring the accuracy from minority classes too instead of measuring only the total accuracy. Adjusting the weighting factors to avoid disparate impact can result in positive discrimination which has also its own issues: disparate treatment.\n* One approach to addressing the problem of class imbalance is to randomly resample the training dataset. This technique can help to rebalance the class distribution when classes are under or over represented:\n - random oversampling (i.e. duplicating samples from the minority class)\n - random undersampling (i.e. deleting samples from the majority class)\n* There are trade-offs when determining an AI system’s metrics for success. It is important to balance performance metrics against the risk of negatively impacting vulnerable populations.\n* When using techniques like statistical generalisation is important to know your data well, and get familiarised with who is and who is not represented in the samples. Check the samples for expectations that can be easily verified. For example, if half the population is known to be female, then you can check if approximately half the sample is female.\n* After deployment, monitor the AI’s performance to catch any unexpected issues.\n* Focus on making the model interpretable so that deployment problems can be quickly identified and addressed.",

For instance, failing to account for a new competitor could mislead predictions. \n*Learning bias: Arises when a model prioritizes one objective, like accuracy, over others, like fairness, leading to skewed outcomes that benefit certain groups.",

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)\n\n* When the agent is learning to perform a complex task, human oversight and feedback are more helpful than just rewards from the environment. Rewards are generally modelled such that they convey to what extent the task was completed, but they do not usually provide sufficient feedback about the safety implications of the agent’s actions. Even if the agent completes the task successfully, it may not be able to infer the side-effects of its actions from the rewards alone. In the ideal setting, a human would provide fine-grained supervision and feedback every time the agent performs an action (Scalable oversight). Though this would provide a much more informative view about the environment to the agent, such a strategy would require far too much time and effort from the human.

There could be a supervisor agent/robot whose task is to assign some work to another agent/robot and provide it with feedback and rewards.\nSource: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/concrete-ai-safety-problems/)",
